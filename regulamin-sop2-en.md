# Recommendations or restrictions on student participation in a course resulting from the required sequence in which the courses should be followed in line with the study plan, and prerequisites

Participation in the Operating Systems 2 course requires passing the courses: Operating Systems 1, Programming 1, Programming 2, Computer Architecture, and Unix System Fundamentals. The student must be able to write and understand programs in the C language and all topics from Operating Systems 1.

# Regulations on student mandatory attendance at courses for which attendance is obligatory, including the allowable limit of non-attendance and justification of non-attendance

  - Attendance at the lectures is not obligatory but recommended due to the close relation between the discussed material and the laboratory.
  - Attendance at the lectures with tests is obligatory. In case of absence, the student receives 0 points for the given lecture test.
  - Attendance at the laboratory classes is obligatory. In case of absence, the student receives 0 points for activities carried during the classes in which he was absent.
  - Absence from two of the assessed laboratory classes L5/L6/L7/L8 results in failure to complete the course.

# Detailed methods of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement (e.g., the number of tests) and types of materials and devices approved for use by students during verification of learning outcomes achievement

The course consists of lectures and laboratories.

## Lecture

There are two lecture tests during the semester.

  - Lecture tests have written, paper form and consist of several open and closed questions regarding topics discussed during the lectures up to given test.
  - Questions may also relate to basic topics discussed during preceding course - Operating Systems 1
  - For both tests one may obtain 100 pts in total. Scoring for each task is given in the task description.

## Laboratory

The laboratory consists of non-graded classes (W4, W5 and W6) and graded classes (L5, L6, L7 and L8). Classes are held according to the schedule provided on the course website. The course website also contains preparatory materials for the classes.

### Graded laboratories
  - Classes W4, W5, and W6 are used to practice the skills tested in graded labs. In order to participate in these classes, at least basic knowledge of the subject is required, which is tested at the beginning of these classes with a short test, for which up to 1.5 points can be obtained.
  - Points can be also awarded points for participating in improvements the course website. The total number of points from workshop tests and this activity cannot exceed 6 points.
  - Classes L5, L6, L7 and L8 are used to assess skills in the area indicated in the course schedule. For each class, students should prepare independently, using the materials on the course website and lecture materials.
  - You can get from 0 to 24 points for the task
  - The time to complete the task is 130 minutes
  - Laboratory tasks are solved using the Arch Linux system on computers in the laboratory. It is not allowed to solve tasks on student's own computer.
  - The programming task is divided into stages. The points for each stage are given in the task description. The stages must be performed in the specified order. You are not allowed to proceed to the next stage without completing the previous ones.
  - Each stage is checked and assessed during the classes. The assessment covers the ability to use appropriate tools and the correct (including POSIX-compliant) implementation of the required functionality.
  - After completing each stage, students submit their solution to the server using the git version control system, as described at W1. Submissions are subject to the following rules:
    - The program must be written in C (not C++).
    - The solution cannot be submitted more often than once a minute.
    - Only the solution files can be modified.
    - Files must be formatted according to the `clang-format` configuration in the task's starter repository (the tool is available on lab computers and its usage is explained during W1).
    - The program must compile without any errors or warnings using the provided makefile.
  - If a solution does not meet one of these conditions, it is rejected, and the student receives feedback on the issue. Submitting the solution to the server is a prerequisite for grading a given stage; unsent solutions will not be graded.
  - During the solving of programming tasks, students **can** use the course website, their own materials, solutions to sample tasks, system documentation and the Internet, but in such a way that the submitted solution is their independent work. In particular, communication with others and the use of AI-based solutions, such as ChatGPT, Github Copilot and similar, is not allowed.



# Schedule of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement, in particular the dates of written and oral tests and deadlines for submission of reports on completed laboratory work and projects, including make-up dates, if the specifics of the course allow for it

The schedule is available on the course website: sop.mini.pw.edu.pl


# Possibility and rules for students’ participation in tests and examinations held on additional dates

Additional exam dates beyond the number required by the study regulations will not be organized.

# Rules for awarding course credit and the final course grade

 - To pass the course, it is necessary to obtain a total of at least 100 points (out of 200 possible), and to attend the number of classes required in the Attendance section. At least 50 points from the lecture part and 50 points from the laboratory part is required
 - The points from the retake always replace the result scored previously
 - **The final course grade** is based on total points acquired by student during the labs and lectures:
   - Grade 5.0 - total in range [180, 200]
   - Grade 4.5 - total in range [160, 180)
   - Grade 4.0 - total in range [140, 160)
   - Grade 3.5 - total in range [120, 140)
   - Grade 3.0 - total in range [100, 120)
   - Grade 2.0 - total in range [0, 100)

# Dates and methods of providing information on the results of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement and grades awarded to students

The results of the laboratories are entered into USOS immediately after each class.

  - Partial grades
    - Number of points obtained for lecture tests is published in USOS at most 2 weeks after given test
    - The number of points obtained for the subsequent stages of the laboratory task is given at the time of checking by the teacher and written on a sheet with the content of the task
    - The number of points obtained for entry is displayed in moodle after the test is completed
    - Points from both parts of the laboratory are placed in USOS no later than 24 hours after the class. 
  - Final grade
    - Issued in USOS within 24 hours from the publication of the results of the last L4 laboratory or second lecture test in USOS (depending on which happens last)
    - Corrected during the exam session within 24 hours from the publication of the results of the retakes in USOS


# The rules for improving the results of partial and/or final verification of learning outcomes achievement and grades awarded to students

At the end of the semester, a retake is organized, during which students can improve the grade obtained in one of the graded laboratories. Registration for the retake will be launched immediately after the last laboratory classes in the semester and will last **24 hours**.

# The rules for retaking particular types of classes included in the course due to unsatisfactory academic progress

A person who has not passed the course must repeat the entire course and take all the assessments. It is not possible to transfer partial points from previous semesters.

# Other information depending on the specifics of the course
